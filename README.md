# MemeMarket: A Solana-based Meme Betting & Launchpad Protocol

**MemeMarket** is a decentralized Solana smart contract where anyone can create a meme-based prediction market.

Users **upvote** or **downvote** memes by staking SOL. After a set time, the **winning side is chosen at random**, and **all stakers on the winning side** share the total reward pool proportionally.

## Memecoin Upgrade

If the **total market liquidity exceeds 10 SOL**, the meme gets upgraded into an actual memecoin and a raydium pool is created:

- ✅ A new **SPL token** is minted  
- 🎁 All winners receive an **airdrop allocation** of the token  
- 💧 An automated **Raydium liquidity pool** is created for instant trading
